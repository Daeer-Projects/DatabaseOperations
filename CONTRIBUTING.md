# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need voluteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

The project is starting small, with a simple backup operation, but with work and effort, it might grow into something that will be used by many.

More details of what the library does, and what features to add can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/daeer73/DatabaseOperations/wiki).

## Testing

There are a few unit tests using the XUnit framework.  I want to keep the unit tests coming, and have them prove any bugs found, and also the fix.

* Use XUnit
* Use FluentAssertions
* Use NSubstitute
* Use Arrange, Act and Assert pattern

## Submitting changes

We welcome changes and help with any of the issues that have been raised.  Some of the issues will have questions that can be answered by anyone.  Good suggestions will be concidered and accepted by the repository owner.

We would like you to follow these guidelines:

1. Create a branch for the issue you are working on.
2. Create the change you feel is right.
3. Commit small and commit often.
4. Always write a clear log message for your commits.
5. Add unit tests around the changes you have made.

## Coding conventions

Start by reading the code base and you will notice how things should be layed out.  We optimise for readability.

* Use spaces, not tabs
* Use `var` unless it is not obvious what the variable will be
* Follow the SOLID principles
* Investigate the options shown in the IDE/ReSharper -> if it looks good, use it, if it becomes unreadable, then don't

## Conclusion

The project is here to help other developers simplify there code base.  It is small and in its infancy.  If we work together, it can become something that will benefit developers for a long time.

I would also like you to enjoy working on the project.  Have fun with it.  If you think of some interesting ways to do things, go with it.

All contributions will be appreciated.

Thanks,

David Clark.
